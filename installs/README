Download the following from the JBoss Customer Portal

 * BRMS (brms-p-5.3.0.GA-standalone.zip)

and copy to this directory for the init.sh script to work.

Ensure that this file is executable by running:

chmod +x <path-to-project>/installs/brms-p-5.3.0.GA-standalone.zip

Note: for now we use ER9, so link to the above with before running init.sh:

ln -s <path-to>/brms-p-5.3.0.BRMS-ER9-standalone.zip ./brms-p-5.3.0.GA-standalone.zip
